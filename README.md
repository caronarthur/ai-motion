## Description
- In this repo you can find the code for a speech emotion recognition python application. We created an API (built with FastAPI and deployed on GCP) and a web-based application (built with Streamlit and deployed on Heroku). The solution relies on 2 parallel deep learning models (built with sklearn and tensorflow keras), can detect 6 different emotions and achieves 81% accuracy on unseen data. We used 4 publicly available datasets (CREMA-D, TESS, SAVEE and RAVDESS).
