# AI-motion
## Description
- In this repo you can find the code for a speech emotion recognition application. We created an API and a web-based application. The solution relies on 2 parallel deep learning models (built with sklearn and tensorflow keras), can detect 6 different emotions and achieves 81% accuracy on unseen data.
